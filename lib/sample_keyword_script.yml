- content: Scientists have devised an exercise in which a hypothetical asteroid 2023
    PDC strikes Earth, calculating the kind of devastation that could ensue from such
    an impact.

- content: The team led by the manager of NASA's Near Earth Object (NEO) Program Office
    Paul Chodas presented the exercise at the 8th Planetary Defence Conference(opens
    in new tab) in Vienna, Austria on Monday, April 4.

- content: The hypothetical situation laid out by Chodas begins on January 10, 2023,
    with the discovery of a new asteroid that receives the name 2023 PDC. The object
    is initially designated a 'potentially hazardous asteroid' (PHA), which NASA defines
    as any asteroid that intersects Earth's orbit at a distance from the planet of
    around 4.6 million miles (7.4 million kilometers) or less and that has a magnitude
    of 22.0 when discovered, which is only a little brighter than the faintest stars
    visible to the Hubble Space Telescope.

- content: The impact probability of 2023 PDC is initially just 1-in-10,000, but Chodas
    explained that this steadily increases, as asteroid tracking facilities on Earth
    continue following the rock, better constraining its orbit around the sun. The
    scenario becomes serious on April 3, 2023, at a point designated 'Epoch 1' by
    Chodas.

- content: At the time of its discovery in this hypothetical scenario, 2023 PDC is
    around 124 million miles (200 million km) from Earth, too far to properly assess
    its orbit.

- content: The reduction of the red 'hitbox' in the team's calculation to less than
    the size of the Earth means that 2023 PDC is going to hit the planet. Astronomers
    can then begin to predict exactly where on Earth the asteroid will make contact
    with the planet.

- content: "So\u2026 What's the damage? NASA Advanced Supercomputing expert Lorien\
    \ Wheeler explained that evaluating the potential damage of 2023 PDC involves\
    \ building an asteroid impact risk assessment model and considering a lot of different\
    \ factors, such as asteroid size and other properties, from limited observational\
    \ data."

- content: ' Wheeler continued that for smaller impacts, outer damage areas are a
    band that could extend to diameters of between 62 miles to 124 miles (100 to 200
    km) outside the main impact zone. This extended damage zone could stretch out
    to diameters as great as 372 miles (600 kilometers) for scenarios in which the
    hypothetical asteroid approaches sizes of 2,000 feet (600 m).'

- content: How worried should we be? It's important to stress that 2023 PDC is a purely
    hypothetical object and it isn't on course to impact Earth. In fact, currently,
    there are no large asteroids predicted to hit Earth for the next 100 years. The
    object with the highest probability of colliding with Earth was the 1,100 feet
    (340 m) wide asteroid 99942 Apophis, which was predicted to get dangerously close
    to Earth in 2068. NASA ruled out this impact in 2021, however, and 99942 Apophis
    will instead harmlessly pass the planet.
