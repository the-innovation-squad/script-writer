    key technologies that could finally turn asteroid mining into a reality. Later
    this year, the startup has a second test flight planned to study a space rock
    up close that could become a prime target for a real mining mission.

    \ AstroForge and other deep-space mining startups are poised to pick up where\
    \ others have failed."

    asteroids are less abundant than carbon-rich asteroids. 'Extracting valuable metals
    is also extraordinarily difficult and technologically challenging,' said Richard
    Binzel, an astronomer who retired last year after spending 33 years teaching planetary
    science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

    \ Kingdom-based Asteroid Mining Corp."
