# üé• Script Writer
This module is designed to convert text stories into video scripts using the YAML format and source appropriate footage to accompany the narration. It automates script formatting and optimization for video production.

The project uses the OpenAI models to generate the video script and curates relevant footage based on the script content through the Pexels API.

## üìú Example Script
Here's a simple example script that can be generated by the app:

```yaml
title: Simple Video Example
timeline:
  - content: "Welcome to our video! This is the first scene with an AI-generated voice."
    clip: "https://shorturl.at/oqJN3"
  - content: "Now, we're moving to the second scene. Enjoy the visuals!"
    clip: "https://shorturl.at/kmBQ6"
  - content: "That's it for our video. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for more content!"
    clip: "https://shorturl.at/bpxX9"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Copy the `.env.sample` file, rename it to `.env`, and fill in the values:
	```bash
	cp .env.sample .env
	```

3. Install the required Python packages:
	```bash
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
	```

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key for OpenAI, can be found at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
- `PEXELS_API_KEY`: The API key for Pexels, can be found at https://www.pexels.com/api/new/

## üöÄ Running the App

1. To run the app, simply execute the following command:
	```bash
	python3 scripts/main.py
	```
	This will create a script video based on the input text and source the appropriate footage.

## üîß Available Arguments

| Short | Long      | Description                                | Type           |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `-d`  | `--debug` | Enable debug mode, and skip tts generation | Flag (boolean) |

### Usage

To run the script with command-line arguments, use the following format:

```bash
python scripts/main.py [-d]
```

## üìñ How the App Works
The app works in the following steps:

1. Read the input text from the input/text.txt file.

2. Generate the keyword script using OpenAI models or use a sample keyword script in debug mode.

3. Add relevant footage to the keyword script using the Pexels API.

4. Write the final script with footage information to the output/output.yml file.
