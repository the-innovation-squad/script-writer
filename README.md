# üé• Script Writer
This module is designed to convert text stories into video scripts using the YAML format and source appropriate footage to accompany the narration. It automates script formatting and optimization for video production.

The project uses the OpenAI models to generate the video script and curates relevant footage based on the script content.

## üìú Example Script
Here's a simple example script that can be generated by the app:

```yaml
title: Simple Video Example
timeline:
  - content: "Welcome to our video! This is the first scene with an AI-generated voice."
    clip: "https://shorturl.at/oqJN3"
  - content: "Now, we're moving to the second scene. Enjoy the visuals!"
    clip: "https://shorturl.at/kmBQ6"
  - content: "That's it for our video. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for more content!"
    clip: "https://shorturl.at/bpxX9"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Copy the `.env.sample` file, rename it to `.env`, and fill in the values:
	```bash
	cp .env.sample .env
	```

3. Install the required Python packages:
	```bash
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
	```

## üöÄ Running the App
